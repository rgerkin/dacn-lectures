    "18) Let's clean up this data a little bit more.  See all the `NaN` values above?  Those correspond to missing data (NaN stands for \"Not a Number\").  We can get rid of rows that have missing data with the `.dropna()` method.  But some missing data is irrelevant to our analysis.  Who cares if the bib number is missing?  Select only those columns we care about (let's say reaction time, round, and gender) using the approach from question 6, and then use `dropna()` on that subset of the columns.  Chain that with `.shape` to see how many rows the remaining data has.  It should be less than the number of rows we started with (because we removed some rows), but still well more than 0!"

    "19) Do Americans sprinters react faster than Canadian sprinters?  No one would ever fund such a study, but you can answer that question right here for free!  Use the `.groupby()` method to aggregate sprinters by country `.groupby('COUNTRY')`, select the reaction time column, and chain it with `.mean()` to compare mean reaction time across countries.  You can further optionally append `[['USAUSA','CANCAN']]` to focus on only those two countries.  Why are all the country names doubled?  I think it is because the person who compiled this dataset likes to say, \"U-S-A!  U-S-A!\" and just repeated that for every country.  "

    "20) So *do* Americans react faster (or slower) than Canadians? In the previous question we only computed the means.  What about the variability?  Let's assume for the moment that a t-test is a good way to compare the two groups.  Extract the two groups using the data using the selector approach from question 16, extract the reaction time from each, drop the missing values, and assigning one to the variable `usa` and the other to the variable `can`.  Don't use `groupby()` here.  Having loaded a t-test function (`ttest_ind` in the cell above), call that function using your selected groups (`ttest_ind(usa,can)`).  Note that you can have multiple command in a code cell, as long each one is on its own line.  "
